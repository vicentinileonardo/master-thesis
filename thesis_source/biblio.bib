abstract = {As the demand for computing continues to grow exponentially and datacenters are already highly optimized, many have suggested leveraging computing workload's spatiotemporal flexibility. However, different workloads may have different degrees of flexibility, including execution deadlines, data protection laws, or latency requirements. These constraints, along with many others, limit the potential benefits of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload shifting; the achievable benefits of these approaches are unclear-an aspect not addressed by prior research. Accurately quantifying the achievable benefits of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload scheduling is critically important, as many in research and industry are already devoting significant time and resources to realize these benefits. To address the problem, we conduct a large-scale longitudinal analysis of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload shifting to answer the following research question: What are the maximum carbon emission reductions that can be achieved due to temporal and spatial workload shifting for different types of cloud workloads and in different parts of the world?},

abstract = {As the size and complexity of Cloud systems increase, the manual management of these solutions becomes a challenging issue as more personnel, resources and expertise are needed. Service Level Agreement (SLA)-aware autonomic cloud solutions enable managing large scale infrastructure management meanwhile supporting multiple dynamic requirement from users. This paper contributes to these topics by the introduction of Cloudcompaas, a SLA-aware PaaS Cloud platform that manages the complete resource lifecycle. This platform features an extension of the SLA specification WS-Agreement, tailored to the specific needs of Cloud Computing. In particular, Cloudcompaas enables Cloud providers with a generic SLA model to deal with higher-level metrics, closer to end-user perception, and with flexible composition of the requirements of multiple actors in the computational scene. Moreover, Cloudcompaas provides a framework for general Cloud computing applications that could be dynamically adapted to correct the QoS violations by using the elasticity features of Cloud infrastructures. The effectiveness of this solution is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation that considers several realistic workload profiles, where Cloudcompaas achieves minimum cost and maximum efficiency, under highly heterogeneous utilization patterns.}

abstract = {Cloud platforms are increasing their emphasis on sustainability and reducing their operational carbon footprint. A common approach for reducing carbon emissions is to exploit the temporal flexibility inherent to many cloud workloads by executing them in periods with the greenest energy and suspending them at other times. Since such suspend-resume approaches can incur long delays in job completion times, we present a new approach that exploits the elasticity of batch workloads in the cloud to optimize their carbon emissions. Our approach is based on the notion of "carbon scaling," similar to cloud autoscaling, where a job dynamically varies its server allocation based on fluctuations in the carbon cost of the grid's energy. We develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing a job's carbon emissions via carbon scaling that is based on the well-known problem of marginal resource allocation. We implement a CarbonScaler prototype in Kubernetes using its autoscaling capabilities and an analytic tool to guide the carbon-efficient deployment of batch applications in the cloud. We then evaluate CarbonScaler using real-world machine learning training and MPI jobs on a commercial cloud platform and show that it can yield i) 51\% carbon savings over carbon-agnostic execution; ii) 37\% over a state-of-the-art suspend-resume policy; and iii) 8 over the best static scaling policy.},
