Intro intro

project divided into 3 parts

data part

ML part

infrastructure part

\section{Context}
\label{sec:context}

Computational sustainability

GreenOps
GreenOps for FinOps
(Operating for GreenOps may lead to reduced costs)

\subsection{GreenOps}
\subsection{Geographical shifting and Time shifting}
\subsection{Carbon-aware workload scheduling}


Cloud sustainability

Current Sustainable Cloud Computing Landscape
we are in the infrastructure tooling section
in particular scheduling (day 1 operatsion

scaling and resource tuning are usuaully day 2 operation

the system was envisioned with this in mind and is capable of doing that


\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problem}

test


Use cases (basic ones for the beginning) higher level explanation here
first use case ("GreenOps" VM scheduling)

second: scaling down a vm 
infrastructure already put in place

the system was designed with flexibility in mind therefore a workload could be anything
the condition is just to be represented in some way and have something else do certain actions based on that representation
As we will see in section XXX, the most simple of this would be K8s operators

\section{Personal contribution}

The project, ideated and supervisioned by Prof. Fiore is mainly divided into 3 parts.

In 

exploratory data analysis (EDA)
data preparation

model training
model selection
