\section{End-to-end integrated test}

A comprehensive end-to-end integrated test has been carried out on a Kubernetes cluster

(dependency graph)



\section{Theoretic upper bound}

 (how close can we get, masachussets amherest group)



\section{Baseline definition}

\section{Black hole phenomenon}

(how it is countered)

\section{Preliminary evaluation}

for the purpose of this theses

boavizta API simulation

assumptions
- analysis limited to only cloud VM, (aligned with the scope of this theses)
- data related to GCP is not data from boavizta (even if gcp is supported in our current system) but mapped from azure and aws

limitations
- whole countries, not regions


not easily integratable in a real production system due to its quite restrictive license (AGPL 3)
it is still usable for research purposes like in this case.
